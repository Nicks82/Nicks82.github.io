My first website.  This was more of a learning experience rather than a professional attempt at making something complete.  It was a good way to learn many different concepts and to prove to myself that I could style a cool website front page.  Some of the buttons don't do anything yet, I want keep testing new ideas before I move forward with this project.  For my first project this was a more advanced than what I anticipated.  In the future I want to make better looking responsive buttons and a better navigation bar.
